<h1>Home Lab & Live Attack Map</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, organizations face an ever-growing threat from cyberattacks that are increasingly sophisticated, persistent, and global in scale. Real-time visibility into these threats is essential for proactive defense and effective incident response. With this cybersecurity project I have leveraged Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Sentinel to design and implement a live attack map—a dynamic visualization tool that displays cyber threats and malicious activity as they occur across the globe.

Using the scalability and flexibility of Microsoft Azure, combined with the advanced threat detection and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) capabilities of Microsoft Sentinel, this project integrates real-time telemetry, log analytics, threat intelligence, and geolocation data. The result is an interactive dashboard that not only illustrates ongoing attacks but also enhances situational awareness for security teams, enabling faster and more informed decision-making.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how cloud-native tools can be harnessed to provide immediate insights into the cyber threat landscape, helping organizations shift from reactive to proactive cybersecurity strategies.
